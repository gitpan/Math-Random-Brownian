Math-Random-Brownian version 0.01
========================

Math::Random::Brownian is a perl interface to multiple methods for
simulating stationary Gaussian processes.  The original C code was written by
Ton Dieker and adapted to perl by Walter Szeliga.  For a copy of the original
unmolested C code see http://homepages.cwi.nl/~ton/fbm/. 

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

Currently, initiation of a Math::Random::Brownian object relies upon both
'time ^ ($$ + ($$ << 15));' and 'time ^ $$ ^ unpack "%L*", `ps axww |
gzip`;' to provide seeds.  Whether this is sufficient or not remains to
be seen.
